**Great Fisherman**

Create simple human skeleton (each bone is simply a capsule or box) with a rod (from elastic material)
in the hand. Figure should be standing near so
me pond. Use inverse kinematics (IK) to animate how the
fisherman throws the hook into the pond (hook must be on a visible nylon). When the hook hits the
water simple waves should start around. After a short while the fisherman starts to twist the rope (use
IK to move other hand in a rotational movement), the nylon should strain and the rod must bend.
Camera can be simple static.
